commands for the simulation :
roslaunch simumap run.launch file:=/home/louis/ros/src/MOBRO_ROS/maps/Eld
with file the path and name of the map file (same name for both pgm and yaml)

commands for cartographer :
roslaunch mobro turtlebot_slam.launch file:=Eone
with file the name of the bag file (in the /home/louis/ros/src/MOBRO_ROS/bag/ directory, or specify the whole path)
then to save the map if it didn't do it automatically :
rosrun map_server map_saver

tune the parameters of cartographer in the lua file in /home/louis/ros/src/MOBRO_ROS/config/

downscale the map before launching the simulation for better performance and change the resolution accordingly
The default resolution is 0.01 (1cm/pixel). Downscaling the image by a factor of 5 and changing the resolution in the corresponding yaml file to 0.05 is recommended

if the simulation crashes with an OpenCV error, disable window resizing (set resizeWindow to false in the simumap launch file)
